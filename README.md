## The problem
Yet another meeting is steering into the wrong direction. Two people have a heated discussion while the other four
wish we could just proceed to the next thing in the agenda.


## The idea
Whole team joins an online "room" anonymously. Each participant can either thumbs-up or thumbs-down the current 
course of the meeting. Total score of thumb-downs is displayed, and it's up for a team to have some ground rules
how to deal with that. Do we stop and change topic after there are 3 thumb-downs on the screen?

## About
It's really just another playground of mine.
